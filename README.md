This is a Modern Scientific Calculator project built using Java Swing, developed as a part of my VaultofCodes internship project. It is designed to perform both basic arithmetic operations and scientific calculations with a clean, responsive, and user-friendly graphical interface.

The purpose of this project is to strengthen my knowledge of:

Java GUI Programming

Event-driven programming

Object-Oriented Design

Scientific functions implementation

This calculator can handle operations like:

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)

Logarithmic and exponential functions

Square root, square, power, percentage, constants like Ï€ and e
